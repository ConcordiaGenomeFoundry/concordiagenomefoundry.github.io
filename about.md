        The Concordia Genome Foundry is Canadaâ€™s platform for synthetic biology.
        </h3> 
        <h3>
        We use lab automation to provide academics and companies with services to 
        engineer biology at a scale beyond manual methods.
        </h3>
        <h3>
        The Genome Foundry is a pioneering facility that employs cutting edge
        robotic instrumentation which enables synthetic biologists to execute work at
        significant scales and speeds. Automation eliminates bottlenecks in the research
        cycle and creates greater capacity for designing experiments and imagining
        possibilities. Foundry projects target high value applications in human health,
        agriculture, chemicals, environmental technologies, and provide a broad
        range of unique training opportunities for high quality professionals in this field.
